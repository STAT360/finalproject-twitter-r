# finalproject

Initial Proposal:
We are creating a Shiny app that will take in a Twitter handle and keyword as input then scrape through that user's timeline to find the word or phrase. We will also have intresting visuals about different popular user's most used words. We also are thinking about doing a sentiment anaylsis on their tweets.

What we expect to find and solve:
    ->We are going to use rTweet package to scrape Twitter's API. The problem we are solving is finding intresting tweets from user's timeline.

Checklist:

__ : Get twitter developer API Key

__ : Get twitteR package into project

__ : Figure out what UI should look like
    -> Text box for twitter user handle
    -> Words or phrases to search for
    
__ : Find out how many API calls we can make without getting locked out by twitter
    -> Caching results? Pick a few users to have their data stored up.

__ : Sentiment scoring?

__ : Some kind of graph? What does that look like? Wordcloud?

__ : Pre-scraping for examples
