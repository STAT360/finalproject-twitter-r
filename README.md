# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

We are creating a Shiny app that will take in a Twitter handle and keyword as input then scrape through that user's timeline to find the word or phrase. We will also have intresting visuals about different popular user's most used words. We also are thinking about doing a sentiment anaylsis on their tweets.

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

    We are going to use rTweet package to scrape Twitter's API. The problem we are solving is finding intresting tweets from user's timeline.
