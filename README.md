# finalproject

Initial Proposal:
We are creating a Shiny app that will take in a Twitter handle and keyword as input then scrape through that user's timeline to find the word or phrase. We will also have intresting visuals about different popular user's most used words. We also are thinking about doing a sentiment anaylsis on their tweets.

What we expect to find and solve:

    We are going to use rTweet package to scrape Twitter's API. The problem we are solving is finding intresting tweets from user's timeline.
